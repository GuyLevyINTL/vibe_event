# Test Documentation for Break Breaker Game

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Break Breaker game, including unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and performance tests.

## Test Structure

```

├── game.test.js           # Unit tests for core game mechanics
├── integration.test.js    # Integration tests for component interactions
├── performance.test.js    # Performance and optimization tests
└── e2e/
    └── game.spec.js       # End-to-end browser tests
```

## Test Types

### 1. Unit Tests (`game.test.js`)

**Coverage:**
- Game initialization and state management
- Paddle movement and boundary detection
- Ball physics and collision detection
- Brick creation and destruction
- Scoring system
- Win/lose conditions
- Utility functions

**Key Test Cases:**
- ✅ Game initializes with correct default values
- ✅ Paddle moves within boundaries
- ✅ Ball bounces off walls correctly
- ✅ Collision detection works for paddle and bricks
- ✅ Lives system functions properly
- ✅ Win condition triggers when all bricks destroyed
- ✅ Lose condition triggers when lives reach zero

### 2. Integration Tests (`integration.test.js`)

**Coverage:**
- Complete game flow sequences
- Component interactions
- State transitions
- Keyboard input handling
- Multi-step operations

**Key Test Cases:**
- ✅ Full game startup sequence
- ✅ Game reset cycle
- ✅ Ball loss and life reduction sequence
- ✅ Game over and win sequences
- ✅ Paddle-ball interactions with angle calculations
- ✅ Sequential brick collisions
- ✅ State persistence across resets

### 3. Performance Tests (`performance.test.js`)

**Coverage:**
- Game loop performance
- Memory usage optimization
- Frame rate consistency
- Resource cleanup
- Edge case performance

**Key Test Cases:**
- ✅ Update cycle completes within performance budget
- ✅ Draw cycle is efficient
- ✅ Collision detection is optimized
- ✅ Memory usage remains stable
- ✅ Consistent frame times
- ✅ Handles rapid state changes

### 4. End-to-End Tests (`e2e/game.spec.js`)

**Coverage:**
- Complete user workflows
- Browser compatibility
- UI interactions
- Responsive design
- Cross-platform functionality

**Key Test Cases:**
- ✅ Game loads correctly in browser
- ✅ All UI elements are visible and functional
- ✅ Keyboard controls work properly
- ✅ Game state updates correctly
- ✅ Responsive design works on different screen sizes
- ✅ Context menu prevention works

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Unit and Integration Tests

```bash
# Run all Jest tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### End-to-End Tests

```bash
# Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run E2E tests with UI
npx playwright test --ui
```

### All Tests

```bash
# Run complete test suite
npm run test:all
```

## Test Configuration

### Jest Configuration (Unit/Integration)

```json
{
  "testEnvironment": "jsdom",
  "setupFilesAfterEnv": ["jest-canvas-mock"],
  "collectCoverageFrom": ["script.js"],
  "coverageReporters": ["text", "lcov", "html"]
}
```

### Playwright Configuration (E2E)

- Tests run on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile and desktop viewports tested
- Automatic retry on CI
- Video and screenshot capture on failure
- Local dev server integration

## Coverage Goals

- **Unit Tests:** >90% code coverage
- **Integration Tests:** All critical user flows
- **E2E Tests:** All major browser compatibility
- **Performance Tests:** All performance-critical operations

## Test Data and Mocks

### Mocked Components

- **Canvas API:** All drawing operations mocked
- **DOM Elements:** Game controls and display elements
- **Animation Frames:** Controlled timing for deterministic tests
- **Performance API:** Time measurement and profiling

### Test Fixtures

- Standard game state configurations
- Various paddle and ball positions
- Different brick arrangements
- Edge case scenarios

## Continuous Integration

Tests are designed to run in CI environments with:

- **Headless browser support** for E2E tests
- **Coverage reporting** for code quality metrics
- **Performance benchmarks** for regression detection
- **Cross-browser testing** for compatibility

## Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests

1. **Unit Tests:** Add to `game.test.js` for new game mechanics
2. **Integration Tests:** Add to `integration.test.js` for component interactions
3. **E2E Tests:** Add to `e2e/game.spec.js` for user workflows
4. **Performance Tests:** Add to `performance.test.js` for optimization validation

### Test Guidelines

- **Isolation:** Each test should be independent
- **Clarity:** Test names should clearly describe what's being tested
- **Coverage:** Aim for both positive and negative test cases
- **Performance:** Keep test execution time reasonable
- **Maintainability:** Use descriptive assertions and good organization

## Debugging Tests

### Jest Tests

```bash
# Run specific test file
npm test game.test.js

# Run tests matching pattern
npm test -- --testNamePattern="paddle movement"

# Debug mode
node --inspect-brk node_modules/.bin/jest --runInBand
```

### Playwright Tests

```bash
# Run with browser UI
npx playwright test --headed

# Debug specific test
npx playwright test --debug

# Generate test code
npx playwright codegen localhost:8080
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Canvas Testing:** Visual canvas output cannot be directly tested
2. **Timing Dependencies:** Some tests may be sensitive to timing
3. **Browser Differences:** Minor differences in browser implementations
4. **Performance Variability:** Performance tests may vary by system

## Future Enhancements

- **Visual Regression Testing:** Screenshot comparison tests
- **Accessibility Testing:** Screen reader and keyboard navigation tests
- **Load Testing:** High-frequency user interaction simulation
- **Mobile Testing:** Touch gesture and responsive design validation
